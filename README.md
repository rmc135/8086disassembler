A simple 8086 disassembler that outputs DEBUG.EXE-like assembly.

I no longer routinely use DOS, so it's pretty cool to be able to use tools like this within a unix environment to examine old DOS files (some of which I coded myself).

It features basic opcode tracing to help determine whether a byte (or series of bytes) is code, or data.

It's still a little buggy with the formatting of some outputs, and I have not extensively tested the validity of its disassembly.

I plan to move to a more generic disassembly library to allow for modularity (eg: output .ASM that can be reassembled, or directly emulate opcodes, or convert to generic C), but this tool is still hopefully still useful as a standalone app.

Note: Input is assumed to be .COM, with entry point at 0100h. Disassembling .EXE (or any other file type) will likely result in (harmless) garbage output.
